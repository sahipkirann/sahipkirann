## What’s inside
- **Web Application Security:** Dynamic and static testing covering OWASP topics (XSS, SQLi, SSRF, IDOR, broken auth/session); PoCs based on Burp/Ffuzz/ffuf/SQLmap/gtfobins; exploit chains and techniques to bypass security controls (CSP, SameSite, rate limiting).

- **Mobile Application Security:** Reverse engineering for Android (Smali/DEX, JADX, apktool) and iOS (ObjC/Swift, class-dump, Hopper/IDA); runtime hooks with Frida/Objection, bypassing root/jailbreak/debugger detections and TLS cert-pinning; WebView/JS bridge, Intent/Deep Link, and Content Provider vulnerabilities.

- **HTB / CTF Machines:** Network discovery (nmap), service fingerprinting, exploit/poison usage, LFI → RCE chains, version-based exploits, pivoting (SSH tunneling, proxychains), privilege escalation (sudo misconfigs, SUID, kernel exploits) and comprehensive write-ups.

- **Malware Development & Analysis:** C2 prototypes, packer/obfuscator techniques, static analysis (strings, YARA, PE/ELF/IPA inspection) and dynamic analysis (sandboxing, process tracing, memory forensics); IoC extraction and mitigation recommendations.
